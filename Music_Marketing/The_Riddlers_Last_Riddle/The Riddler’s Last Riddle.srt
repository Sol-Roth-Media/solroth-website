1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:12,000
 In his hand, the notes said, alas a prophecy to heed in time.

2
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
 Set there is a rhythm to a rhyme, a rhyme to a rhythm a key to unwind the flaws between your bars and your lines

3
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 p..p...poison gas, the riddle's last riddle blows past the joker's last laugh HAAA

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:24,000
 If crazy I'd be then I'd be freed of all reason so no point believing that hatred you're squeezing

5
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:28,000
 So shut your mouth or it'll get beaten when I tear off your sheet to reveal the true heathen

6
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 You're in need of parental suspension of the over-abundance of attention

7
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
 Mama should've taught you to hide that micro-erection

8
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 Consider this your cranially retentive mental health intervention

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:40,000
 Pre-flight inspection to reveal a spinal hyperextension that finally gave way

10
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:45,000
 Now boarding, one through nine, session

11
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:51,000
 Consider this your cranially retentive mental health intervention

12
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
 Now boarding, one through nine, interception

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 What does it mean to be me?

14
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:07,000
 Am I a hero or am I a demon's dream?

15
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:12,000
 What does it mean to be me?

16
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 Born to be a hero but I still got that demon scene

17
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
 One through nine, read the display, black monochrome reflection

18
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:27,000
 We're in transit to the fray of inception so trays up, seats back, this is the finale

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
 Your final destination, you're a state of unreal it seems

20
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 Forever stuck in sucking life's long punctuated fallacy

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
 But damn, man's duality is a two-sided boat, notes burning in a sea of right and wrong

22
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
 You see a nice part of me, a truce of one but the other truce sees no sea

23
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 Paired to intersect thee, he or she will be or not to be

24
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:42,000
 Throwing down no no holds bared scared straight barometry

25
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
 Gravitate implicit forces all on me

26
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 Run, run, fight, you fit to fight, but fled left when heroes run right

27
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
 A coward, All talk, no bite, fright the knight

28
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:50,000
 I raided all night pretending, still stuck benching

29
0:01:50,000 --> 0:01:52,000
 Quit night, shit night, you not wrenching

30
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
 Oh, your balls are not descending, impending

31
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
 You're pulling up stuff, crated, ruled, not descending

32
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 Inside you ignited, a swollen engulf

33
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 In flames of contagious, contagion of failures

34
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
 Fucking fall in rage, so rage on, son

35
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
 So soon you'll be baited with the rage and hatred you're spraying

36
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 Constant inconsistence, we go with that which is so faded

37
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 The lathe, yes, I go, now you're flated

38
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:10,000
 Seem to stay here

39
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:11,000
 Just change it, that's all what you got

40
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
 That's all what you said and that what you want

41
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 That's all what the world has got when it lives

42
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:22,000
 That's what we all got left to give
