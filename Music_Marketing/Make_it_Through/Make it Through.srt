0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:12,600
 We've come a long way in such a short time, but even now

2
0:00:12,600 --> 0:00:19,040
 Sometimes it feels like the world is against me

3
0:00:19,040 --> 0:00:29,680
 Sometimes it feels like I'm never enough Sometimes it feels like I'm running on empty

4
0:00:29,680 --> 0:00:37,680
 And I realise you're already with me So it's never too rough

5
0:00:37,680 --> 0:00:50,920
 And we will never give up We'll be strong and we'll be brave

6
0:00:50,920 --> 0:00:59,920
 We won't let them get in our way No stick together, make it through

7
0:00:59,920 --> 0:01:07,120
 We don't need no one but me and you, me and you

8
0:01:07,120 --> 0:01:15,960
 I know I'm not the only one having trouble I know I'm not the only one seeing double,

9
0:01:15,960 --> 0:01:20,000
 seeing double I know I'm not the only one to say I can't

10
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:26,760
 go on without time Time to get through this weather

11
0:01:26,760 --> 0:01:33,240
 Time to rough it up and be the better Time to realise that with you

12
0:01:33,240 --> 0:01:46,960
 We'll always find a way to stick through We don't need anyone else right now

13
0:01:46,960 --> 0:01:54,960
 We'll be strong and we'll be brave We won't let them get in our way

14
0:01:54,960 --> 0:02:04,600
 We'll stick together, make it through We don't need anyone but me and you, me and

15
0:02:04,600 --> 0:02:13,920
 you Sometimes it feels like the road is too long

16
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:24,400
 Sometimes it feels like I just don't belong Sometimes it feels like we're living

17
0:02:24,400 --> 0:02:35,600
 We don't give up or end We keep going till the end

18
0:02:35,600 --> 0:02:45,560
 We'll be strong and we'll be brave We won't let them get in our way

19
0:02:45,560 --> 0:02:55,480
 We'll stick together, make it through We don't need anyone but me and you, me and

20
0:02:55,480 --> 0:03:05,000
 you We'll be strong and we'll be brave

21
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:12,200
 We won't let them get in our way We'll stick together, make it through

22
0:03:12,200 --> 0:03:24,401
 We don't need anyone but me and you, me and you
