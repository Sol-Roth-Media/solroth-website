1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:16,480
 As I lay my soul to bare You just sit there with pretty hair

2
0:00:16,480 --> 0:00:21,960
 Is all this talk just in vain Am I a shadow in the rain

3
0:00:21,960 --> 0:00:27,280
 All this love goes down the drain I'm a shadow in the rain

4
0:00:27,280 --> 0:00:37,240
 Lost in my thoughts, can't shake the past I try to move on but it's never gonna last

5
0:00:37,240 --> 0:00:43,080
 Stuck in a cycle, can't escape the pain I'm just a shadow in the rain

6
0:00:43,080 --> 0:00:48,400
 I'm reaching out but no one cares So fuck it all, there's no one there

7
0:00:48,400 --> 0:00:53,960
 I'm just a ghost in an empty space Memory, a forgotten place

8
0:00:53,960 --> 0:00:59,120
 As I lay my soul to bare You just sit there with pretty hair

9
0:00:59,120 --> 0:01:04,640
 Is all this talk just in vain As my life goes down the drain

10
0:01:04,640 --> 0:01:09,640
 Just a shadow in the rain I'm just a shadow

11
0:01:09,640 --> 0:01:17,680
 I'm just a shadow in the rain Drowning in our memory

12
0:01:17,680 --> 0:01:21,720
 Lost in darkness, so it seems Can't find a way out

13
0:01:21,720 --> 0:01:28,400
 Stuck in time, reflection of a love that died I'm reaching out but no one cares

14
0:01:28,400 --> 0:01:33,800
 So fuck it all, there's no one there I'm just a ghost in this empty space

15
0:01:33,800 --> 0:01:39,160
 A memory, forgotten place As I lay my soul to bare

16
0:01:39,160 --> 0:01:44,680
 You just sit there with pretty hair Is this talk all in vain

17
0:01:44,680 --> 0:01:49,960
 Is there something more to say I'm a shadow in the rain

18
0:01:49,960 --> 0:01:57,800
 Just a shadow in the rain I'm a shadow in the rain

19
0:01:57,800 --> 0:02:03,160
 I search for answers in a world so cold This broken heart is getting old

20
0:02:03,160 --> 0:02:08,640
 I wanna play but I'm forced to fold I don't know where the story holds

21
0:02:08,640 --> 0:02:13,920
 Will this end right, will it go Is this all I have to show

22
0:02:13,920 --> 0:02:19,480
 Will I be okay on my own?

23
0:02:19,480 --> 0:02:24,480
 As I lay my soul to bare You just sit there with pretty hair

24
0:02:24,480 --> 0:02:30,160
 Is all this talk just in vain Am I a shadow in the rain?

25
0:02:30,160 --> 0:02:35,320
 All this love goes down the drain I'm a shadow in the rain

26
0:02:35,320 --> 0:02:50,680
 I'm a shadow in the rain
