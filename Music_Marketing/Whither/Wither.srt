1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,000
 We were young and naive but I thought we could control it

2
0:00:10,000 --> 0:00:15,000
 But then life took me for a ride

3
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:20,000
 You went and I spiraled forward

4
0:00:20,000 --> 0:00:26,000
 Handing down as my life lost its purpose

5
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 I was without my way

6
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 I lost my faith in a downward spiral

7
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:40,000
 And now I start to rebuild it

8
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:45,000
 Build it in a circle

9
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
 I lost my way

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:54,000
 My faith in a downward spiral

11
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 I watch my life wither away

12
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:04,000
 In the gutter where I pray

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:10,000
 A thousand miles on the open road

14
0:01:10,000 --> 0:01:15,000
 Blackened sky, story untold

15
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:21,000
 If I listen to my dreams

16
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
 If I hear you in my sleep

17
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
 If I scream into my fears

18
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 Would you listen to it all?

19
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:45,000
 But the world kept me again

20
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
 And again and again

21
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:54,000
 I can never seem to die

22
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 I'm the unlucky and they're lucky

23
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:04,000
 I watch my life wither away

24
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
 In the gutter where I pray

25
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 A thousand miles on the open road

26
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:20,000
 Blackened sky, story untold

27
0:02:20,000 --> 0:02:25,000
 I watch my life wither away

28
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,961
 I lost my faith
