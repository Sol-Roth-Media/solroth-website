0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,000
 Do you ever get lonely when you're here by yourself?

2
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:24,000
 Do I ever cross your mind when you're gone now for long?

3
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 Cause I know that it's a long shot, you're a thousand miles away

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:48,000
 And every time I see your face, it's like we're back there on that day

5
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 And the pain in your eyes and the smile that you're trying to hide, oh yeah

6
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 I know I wasn't perfect, I know it's okay

7
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:23,000
 But I never felt so worthless when I walked away that day

8
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 So will you please find a way to hear me through today

9
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 And we'll hold out on a lonely sign

10
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

11
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:10,000
 And I don't know when I'll turn around and walk the other way

12
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:20,061
 Oh I still love you, and every day
