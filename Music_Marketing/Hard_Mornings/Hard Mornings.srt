1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,440
 I'm not sick of this world, I'm just so sick of the pain

2
0:00:13,440 --> 0:00:16,000
 Before I do something stupid and I open a vein

3
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,720
 I put a bottle to my head to inject vodka to the brain

4
0:00:18,720 --> 0:00:23,600
 I cry out, but demons call back my name I'm supposed to be silent, strong, and always

5
0:00:23,600 --> 0:00:26,600
 in frame But what should I do when I can't calm the

6
0:00:26,600 --> 0:00:27,600
 rage?

7
0:00:27,600 --> 0:00:30,720
 It burns as it starts to spread the craze A poison's fired and I'm this pain

8
0:00:30,720 --> 0:00:34,200
 I want to be sober and someday I may But I may just need to exit the cage

9
0:00:34,200 --> 0:00:36,360
 My body's on the thunder now as the last breath of the brain

10
0:00:36,360 --> 0:00:39,520
 I black out, I drink, I drink, I drink, I drink until I'm insane

11
0:00:39,520 --> 0:00:41,240
 No thoughts of tomorrow, I'm wretched and stained

12
0:00:41,240 --> 0:00:45,080
 I'll break down and pray, please, please, please Help me be strong to find better days

13
0:00:45,080 --> 0:00:47,280
 I know it's sobriety or it's one foot in the grave

14
0:00:47,280 --> 0:00:56,280
 All over morning, my headache enraged Like it's raining down raises as I wait for

15
0:00:56,280 --> 0:01:02,280
 the blame I've got so much to lose and so little to

16
0:01:02,280 --> 0:01:09,280
 gain So be brave, be brave, and be sober and pray

17
0:01:09,280 --> 0:01:13,280
 I wrote this verse a little too late The one I was trying to save has already sealed

18
0:01:13,280 --> 0:01:16,280
 their fate But I'm still out here slinging some words

19
0:01:16,280 --> 0:01:18,280
 and lyrics Cause maybe I'll reach somebody out there

20
0:01:18,280 --> 0:01:20,280
 still ringing Maybe their phone's still there, there's

21
0:01:20,280 --> 0:01:24,280
 still time to save them There's still somewhere out there in the

22
0:01:24,280 --> 0:01:28,280
 cold darkness The world can be so fucking cruel, just darkness

23
0:01:28,280 --> 0:01:30,280
 and rain I understand you're out there with the pain

24
0:01:30,280 --> 0:01:36,280
 and the pain and the pain The one I was trying to save has already

25
0:01:36,280 --> 0:01:39,280
 sealed their fate

26
0:01:39,280 --> 0:01:42,280
 All over morning, my headache enraged Like it's raining down raises as I wait for

27
0:01:42,280 --> 0:01:47,280
 the blame I've got so much to lose and so little to

28
0:01:47,280 --> 0:01:54,280
 gain So be brave, be brave, and be sober and pray

29
0:01:54,280 --> 0:01:58,280
 There's still time to save them There's still somewhere out there in the

30
0:01:58,280 --> 0:02:02,280
 cold darkness The world can be so fucking cruel, just darkness

31
0:02:02,280 --> 0:02:04,280
 and rain I understand you're out there with the pain

32
0:02:04,280 --> 0:02:07,280
 and the pain and the pain But there's usually someone, someone that

33
0:02:07,280 --> 0:02:10,280
 would've helped you if they'd only known But you didn't tell them cause you need to

34
0:02:10,280 --> 0:02:12,280
 tell them Cause then you don't have to walk that fucking

35
0:02:12,280 --> 0:02:15,280
 road on your own Just pick up that goddamn phone

36
0:02:15,280 --> 0:02:18,280
 I wrote this song slaying some words instead of going back in time

37
0:02:18,280 --> 0:02:22,280
 Cause I would've helped by just getting through anything but instead

38
0:02:22,280 --> 0:02:25,280
 There's still time to save them There's still somewhere out there in the

39
0:02:25,280 --> 0:02:29,280
 cold darkness The world can be so fucking cruel, just darkness

40
0:02:29,280 --> 0:02:31,280
 and rain I understand you're out there with the pain

41
0:02:31,280 --> 0:02:33,280
 and the pain and the pain But there's usually someone, someone that

42
0:02:33,280 --> 0:02:36,280
