0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,000
 Agility

2
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:19,000
 I have the agility and phonic ability to rhyme each syllable in trilogy

3
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:26,000
 And the humility to perceive the futility of trying to rhyme from a lyrical shooting spree

4
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:30,000
 Danger's immune to me, that's an untrue fact

5
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:35,000
 But what I have achieved is para-rhyme consonance mastery

6
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
 So you damn me can't teach you to compare you to me

7
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
 Rap singing, sing the flow and let it roll and go

8
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:51,000
 And let it flip off your tongue and then when you're done it goes right back out we go

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:57,000
 Now it's time to fucking diss, the rappers stop crunching in a cultural abyss

10
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:00,000
 They're slurring their words and it can barely make sense

11
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 That you can't stand the stench, your bars so sloppy they have no pretext

12
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
 I think deeper to refer it's own intention, long before they got monotone

13
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:28,000
 A self mediocrity, there is a class on sucking life's empathy

14
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 Their sounds still wonder what it means to me, like they echo in silence

15
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 Not symmetry, not symmetry, as perhaps caused by a brain freeze telemetry

16
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:43,000
 They're the ones who chop down the giving tree

17
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:49,000
 So let's see, they're a hoppy wailing on two skinnies, you're a clown, a class two leffy

18
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:55,000
 Ah, the one that's named in the toilet seat, gibberish or sharpie

19
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:01,000
 Now it's time to fucking diss, the rappers stop crunching in a cultural abyss

20
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
 They're slurring their words and it can barely make sense

21
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:10,000
 That you can't stand the stench, your bars so sloppy they have no pretext

22
0:02:10,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 Now it's time to fucking diss, the rappers stop crunching in a cultural abyss

23
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:21,000
 They're slurring their words and it can barely make sense

24
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 Punch drunk, I can still rap straight lines from a Shakespearean soliloquy

25
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
 No seriously, I talk to myself all day for free

26
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:30,000
 And I'll break the fourth wall, whenever I please

27
0:02:30,000 --> 0:02:33,241
 Aye, it's me
