1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:13,920
 Rise above a mindless trace And find a way to save the base

2
0:00:13,920 --> 0:00:16,840
 We're creators brave the artist's face Hollow waves refrained with grit

3
0:00:16,840 --> 0:00:20,200
 We plug it, we fuck it, we make it fit We fierce the face of fearless wits

4
0:00:20,200 --> 0:00:21,200
 So fuck the haters and post that shit

5
0:00:21,200 --> 0:00:24,360
 I'm out the fog, gray of ace Most wheels popped off its corporate case

6
0:00:24,360 --> 0:00:27,360
 An al-Qad without the mushy and graced Afraid of roaming up the pace

7
0:00:27,360 --> 0:00:31,880
 Defy the new and up the space We out the lurkers, rest in place

8
0:00:31,880 --> 0:00:34,280
 We're passing through the new found places And out the ways to raise the base

9
0:00:34,280 --> 0:00:36,800
 And out the lurkers, rest in case

10
0:00:36,800 --> 0:00:40,480
 Caught talent's eye with a forge that's lit This rag ran high but the city blitz

11
0:00:40,480 --> 0:00:44,240
 Sky does fall, sounds all of it So drop the lines, drip by drop by drip

12
0:00:44,240 --> 0:00:46,480
 To make it fit, we fierce the face of fearless wits

13
0:00:46,480 --> 0:00:49,280
 So fuck the haters and post that shit

14
0:00:49,280 --> 0:00:52,480
 I'm out the drip by drop by drip by drop land

15
0:00:52,480 --> 0:00:55,680
 An artist cries of tears telling it's been

16
0:00:55,680 --> 0:01:03,600
 Drip by drop by drip by drop land An artist cries of tears telling it's been

17
0:01:03,600 --> 0:01:07,200
 Catch me cam, my inspiration chase I ain't afraid, fear not man nor man has

18
0:01:07,200 --> 0:01:08,960
 made No humiliation, all a race

19
0:01:08,960 --> 0:01:12,000
 I stand up to eject or embrace To take the spotlight and craze

20
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
 The days, days, days, the day's light

21
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
 I'm balls to the wall, hard work with no rest

22
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,800
 When I'm down I tell time to regress Before I go I reset the saloon

23
0:01:18,800 --> 0:01:22,000
 Rip off the riptide, spend it flow Head to head, toe to coat red

24
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:23,520
 Ripple through the carrots, I got a flag

25
0:01:23,520 --> 0:01:25,760
 What? Drink this with coffee, we made you awake

26
0:01:25,760 --> 0:01:28,640
 Proud be the artist, your name, the namesake Pillagers, ignite the game, shake and trace

27
0:01:28,640 --> 0:01:32,320
 Like a canine's bite or a freak in the base Ain't no inspo from a derivative lease

28
0:01:32,320 --> 0:01:34,320
 Like a stalker's echo, so loud we would creep it

29
0:01:34,320 --> 0:01:37,920
 Huddled around so closely, we'd deep it Proud be the battle hymn sung from the glade pit

30
0:01:37,920 --> 0:01:39,760
 Turn off the ground, just churned on the grave bit

31
0:01:42,080 --> 0:01:44,400
 Oh, take a hold of it, sit there, we're gonna throw down low

32
0:01:44,400 --> 0:01:46,080
 I feel that we sound low, the whole bit by bit

33
0:01:46,080 --> 0:01:47,520
 Quick slip, the lyrical visitor we mix

34
0:01:47,520 --> 0:01:49,760
 First cringe, triple record, we racked up, we sing

35
0:01:49,760 --> 0:01:51,760
 We spun, ends undone, we record, we sung

36
0:01:51,760 --> 0:01:54,160
 I know I won, fantastic stones, no red bones

37
0:01:54,160 --> 0:01:55,920
 But I'm by our stop and follow

38
0:01:55,920 --> 0:01:58,000
 Unite the creative powers and take it all on

39
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:00,320
 But together we got this, the red light's gone

40
0:02:00,320 --> 0:02:02,400
 Turn off, then turn on, go, but not gone

41
0:02:02,400 --> 0:02:04,480
 Hollow, we left or right, but we're strong

42
0:02:04,480 --> 0:02:06,000
 Life beyond, not what it'd be

43
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:07,840
 But a lesson beyond, we're emotional trees

44
0:02:07,840 --> 0:02:11,120
 We're only subtle calm, from storms, break brains, freeze

45
0:02:11,760 --> 0:02:13,520
 Life is a game, so players play tight

46
0:02:13,520 --> 0:02:15,680
 I feel the beams, our creators create their own light

47
0:02:15,680 --> 0:02:17,120
 This is the journey and it's own plight

48
0:02:17,120 --> 0:02:18,061
 If your life is the plane
