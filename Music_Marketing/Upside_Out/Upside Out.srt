0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:19,920
 I can't figure it out How you got me going upside inside out

2
0:00:19,920 --> 0:00:24,800
 My heart is going downside upside now Round and round and round

3
0:00:24,800 --> 0:00:31,680
 Now I can't figure this out My heart is full of doubt

4
0:00:31,680 --> 0:00:38,400
 As it goes upside outside in Round and round upside downside now

5
0:00:38,400 --> 0:00:44,880
 My heart is beating loud I try to keep my head above the water

6
0:00:44,880 --> 0:00:51,040
 But my heart is like a son and daughter Fighting for the upper hand

7
0:00:51,040 --> 0:00:57,840
 It leaves me out in no man's land I can't figure this out

8
0:00:57,840 --> 0:01:04,560
 My head is full of doubt Beating to the ground

9
0:01:04,560 --> 0:01:07,920
 While my heart is spinning round Round and round and round

10
0:01:07,920 --> 0:01:14,160
 I'm feeling outside inside out Downside upside now

11
0:01:14,160 --> 0:01:19,520
 My heart is spinning upside downside out My heart is beating loud

12
0:01:19,520 --> 0:01:22,800
 Spinning round and round Round and round and round

13
0:01:22,800 --> 0:01:29,920
 I used to think we had it all together But now I think our love is like a tether

14
0:01:30,800 --> 0:01:36,320
 Holding on to what's left From a love that once was so deaf

15
0:01:36,320 --> 0:01:42,560
 My head stuck in the cloud I'm looking out

16
0:01:42,560 --> 0:01:49,840
 Tomorrow will bring a change Maybe love will come my way

17
0:01:49,840 --> 0:01:54,240
 Until then I can say My heart is going round

18
0:01:54,240 --> 0:02:00,320
 Round and round and round My heart goes upside inside out

19
0:02:00,320 --> 0:02:07,280
 Downside inside now My heart is going upside inside out

20
0:02:07,280 --> 0:02:09,801
 Downside upside now My heart is
