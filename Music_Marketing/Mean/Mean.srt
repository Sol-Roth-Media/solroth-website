1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,180
 Do you even mean the nice things?

2
0:00:05,180 --> 0:00:11,660
 What you said when we had ice cream Are relationships in tatters

3
0:00:11,660 --> 0:00:16,860
 And you still throw dark matter With your words cut deep like daggers

4
0:00:16,860 --> 0:00:25,220
 My heart is fully shattered You say the most awful things to me

5
0:00:25,220 --> 0:00:36,960
 Verbal abuse is not my scene Nothing fucking matters if you're mean

6
0:00:36,960 --> 0:00:42,480
 Cause nothing fucking matters Nothing fucking matters

7
0:00:42,480 --> 0:00:51,040
 Nothing fucking matters if you're mean Verbal abuse is not my scene

8
0:00:51,040 --> 0:00:55,640
 Cause nothing fucking matters if you're mean

9
0:00:55,640 --> 0:01:00,880
 I love it when you're loving So sweet and overcoming

10
0:01:00,880 --> 0:01:06,560
 But I can't keep on shoving When you beat me down I'm numbing

11
0:01:06,560 --> 0:01:11,320
 Yes we've made a come up And I love it when we make up

12
0:01:11,320 --> 0:01:17,600
 But all these insults keep beating me down And I can't keep shoving down

13
0:01:17,600 --> 0:01:21,720
 My feelings of disgust As you keep trying to hurt us

14
0:01:21,720 --> 0:01:29,800
 It's like you're critiquing every single thing Every way I do anything at all

15
0:01:29,800 --> 0:01:36,400
 And I can't take this anymore Cause nothing fucking matters if you're mean

16
0:01:36,400 --> 0:01:41,320
 I know that I'm not perfect And I probably deserve it

17
0:01:41,320 --> 0:01:47,360
 But that doesn't mean it's worth it For you to insult me like you do

18
0:01:47,360 --> 0:01:56,640
 It's just a dozen wishes, a loving spark All it does is make me wanna leave

19
0:01:56,640 --> 0:02:03,280
 Nothing fucking matters if you're mean Cause nothing fucking matters

20
0:02:03,280 --> 0:02:11,280
 Nothing fucking matters if you're mean Cause nothing fucking matters if you're mean

21
0:02:11,280 --> 0:02:22,000
 You're mean, you're mean Cause nothing fucking matters if you're mean

22
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:28,841
 Verbal abuse is not my sin
