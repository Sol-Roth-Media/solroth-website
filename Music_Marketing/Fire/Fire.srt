0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,000
 It's a Friday and I'm all alone Thinking what I might do when I come and see you

2
0:00:10,000 --> 0:00:15,000
 And then I hear that you're back Rebounding and all of that

3
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 But what a night to go Go get that chance back

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:26,000
 To find the fire we once knew To see it right and make it through

5
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
 Can we ever make this right? Can we be fire, fire

6
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
 Fire on a Friday night

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:47,000
 Hotter than a fire fight I saw you and I know you'll see me too

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 It felt like you were miles away But now you're right there, back to where I knew

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 I knew you'd make it here someway, somehow But I didn't think I'd find a way

10
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:04,000
 Catch the fire we once had To feel the heat as it burns inside

11
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:13,000
 I'm hotter than a fire fight I can't escape once the flame is caught within my sight

12
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:19,000
 Fire, fire

13
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:24,000
 It's fire on a Friday night

14
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:30,000
 You got that fire, fire

15
0:01:30,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 Hotter than a fire fight

16
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:41,000
 And we're chasing after something that we just cannot contain

17
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:46,000
 The fire that it burns inside the sea and just don't flame

18
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:52,000
 It's a desire that we just cannot attain

19
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 Just chasing after something if we can just obey

20
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 Keep that fire alive

21
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
 Keep that fire alive

22
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 We're on a journey, dreams are hard following our dreams

23
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
 No matter where they start Driven by a fire, the fire that burns deep within

24
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:23,000
 We're unstoppable, we're driven by a fire that it burns so deep within

25
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:29,000
 We're unstoppable, unbreakable

26
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:34,000
 We're reaching for the stars, we're chasing out our wildest whim

27
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:39,000
 We're unstoppable, our mission a team to get the whim

28
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:44,000
 We're unstoppable, unbreakable on fire

29
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
 It's so hot, it is my fire

30
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:55,000
 My fire on a Friday, a Friday night

31
0:02:55,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 When you walked back into my little life

32
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:06,000
 I thought I had it all on lockdown and everything was tame

33
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:11,000
 Then I saw you light that fire on me, that Friday game

34
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:17,000
 Cause fire, fire

35
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:22,741
 Your fire on a Friday night
