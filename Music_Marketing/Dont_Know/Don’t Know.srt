1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:11,000
 All I am and all I need is all I ever wanted

2
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:16,000
 And smile and scream and feel the pain

3
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:30,000
 And when the time is energy, all you need becomes love, all you need becomes sound

4
0:00:30,000 --> 0:00:41,000
 How do I get past this point to have those dreams we never had?

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:54,000
 I don't know what this path leads, but all this pain is killing me

6
0:00:54,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 At first I loved the excitement, but I cannot live in your violence

7
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:12,000
 Toxic swings that fuck off the silence, no, I cannot live in your violence

8
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
 Oh, oh, why do we say it'll be alright

9
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 When there's no doubt the end is fast, it's all pain and broken hearts

10
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:45,000
 Shattered dreams and false starts, can we go away from here?

11
0:01:45,000 --> 0:02:00,000
 I hold the memory of life so dear, I want to say so many things but I'm stuck in a lie

12
0:02:00,000 --> 0:02:11,000
 I want to know where the end goes when you leave and go

13
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 It's exciting, I can no longer take the pain, I cannot live in your violence
