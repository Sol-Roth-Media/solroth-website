1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:06,000
 Can it be? Can this get any better than it seems?

2
0:00:06,000 --> 0:00:11,000
 Or is this the top of what life's supposed to be?

3
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:16,000
 I don't know

4
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
 If all I have is one more day, I'd spend it home with you

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:29,000
 Instead of traveling, let's snuggle up and watch some S.F.

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
 If I had a moment, I'd just smile and say

7
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:43,000
 That I'm so happy that I get to spend my final day with you

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
 With you, with you, I always knew

9
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:50,000
 That I could see this whole thing through

10
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 Love and love, our love is true

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
 Me and you, forever two

12
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 We're on our way, my love

13
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
 The time's just passing by

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
 I'm breathing what you smell like

15
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 As our lives intertwine

16
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:16,000
 All alone I was before I saw you

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
 Sitting there, divine

18
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
 All I know is that our love

19
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 Till the end of time

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
 With you, with you, I always knew

21
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 That I could see this whole thing through

22
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
 Love and love, our love is true

23
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
 Me and you, forever two

24
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
 With you, with you, I always knew

25
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
 That I could see this whole thing through

26
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:54,000
 All alone I was before I saw you

27
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 Sitting there, divine

28
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
 Love before the end of all

29
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 Love before the end of all time

30
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 We're on our way, my love

31
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 The time's just passing by

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 I'm breathing what you smell like

33
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
 As our lives intertwine

34
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
 All alone I was before I saw you

35
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 Sitting there, divine

36
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
 All I know is that our love

37
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:49,000
 Till the end of time

38
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:50,000
 Time, time, time, time

39
0:02:50,000 --> 0:02:53,000
 Saw you on the laundry mat

40
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
 Stuffing your last dollar

41
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 In the machine trying to get out

42
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:02,881
 The spilled pasta from last night
