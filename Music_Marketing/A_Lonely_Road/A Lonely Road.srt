1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:15,800
 On a lonely road alone, I hear the wind that blows

2
0:00:15,800 --> 0:00:22,040
 It's cold and empty feeling, but I keep on moving

3
0:00:22,040 --> 0:00:29,040
 On a lonely road alone, I'm searching for a way to call my home

4
0:00:29,040 --> 0:00:38,040
 I don't know where I'm going, but I'll keep, keep, keep on moving

5
0:00:38,040 --> 0:00:43,040
 Keep on moving

6
0:00:43,040 --> 0:00:52,040
 I've been down this road before, I've seen the darkness of the storm

7
0:00:52,040 --> 0:01:05,040
 But I won't, but I won't let it get me, I'll keep moving, moving on

8
0:01:05,040 --> 0:01:13,040
 On a lonely road alone, searching for ways to call my home

9
0:01:13,040 --> 0:01:19,040
 I don't know where I'm going, but I'll keep moving

10
0:01:19,040 --> 0:01:26,040
 There are days when I feel lost, days when I wonder what's the cause

11
0:01:26,040 --> 0:01:31,040
 But I won't give up the fight, not that easily I might

12
0:01:31,040 --> 0:01:37,040
 But I gotta keep moving, moving, moving on

13
0:01:37,040 --> 0:01:43,040
 On a lonely road alone, searching for a way to call my home

14
0:01:43,040 --> 0:01:50,040
 But I know, I don't know where I'm going, I'm lost without reason

15
0:01:50,040 --> 0:02:02,040
 But I won't stop believing, so I'll keep on moving, I'll keep on moving on

16
0:02:02,040 --> 0:02:07,040
 On a lonely road alone

17
0:02:07,040 --> 0:02:17,040
 And I search, and I search, and I search, I know, for the reason to call this searching home

18
0:02:17,040 --> 0:02:24,040
 And I know, cause I know, cause I know, I don't know where I'm going

19
0:02:24,040 --> 0:02:32,040
 But I'll still be believing that if I keep on moving, and just keep moving

20
0:02:32,040 --> 0:02:38,040
 Then one day, I'll see beyond the storm

21
0:02:38,040 --> 0:02:43,040
 Cause I'm still here, and I'm still going

22
0:02:43,040 --> 0:02:49,040
 For a world after all this, I can't let it hit me

23
0:02:49,040 --> 0:02:57,040
 Cause I'm on a lonely road alone, and I'm searching for a way home

24
0:02:57,040 --> 0:03:03,040
 Cause I know
