1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:07,000
 Take a walk in the dark, take a walk in the darkness

2
0:00:07,000 --> 0:00:11,000
 Everything dark but your eyes

3
0:00:11,000 --> 0:00:14,000
 Is this our moment

4
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 When we see what's inside

5
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:27,000
 My love, my hair, our heart in our bed

6
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:32,000
 Are we sleeping inside

7
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
 At night, our pain, our hearts, our sweat

8
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
 Are they trapped in a bed of lies

9
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:49,000
 Oh, our love, our love is all here

10
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 That's filled with the word of lies

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:01:00,000
 But I lay here before you in the night

12
0:01:00,000 --> 0:01:06,000
 Lying dead by the side

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:13,000
 And you both know the ride

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:21,000
 If you're ready, you can hear it inside

15
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
 Because I know

16
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 The stories of our lives

17
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
 Even when we cry

18
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:40,000
 I know

19
0:01:40,000 --> 0:01:46,000
 We're all frozen inside

20
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
 Our love, our love is all here

21
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:58,000
 That's filled with the word of lies

22
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 If you're ready, you can hear it inside

23
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
 Because I know

24
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:16,000
 Maybe

25
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:20,000
 Even when the bed of lies

26
0:02:20,000 --> 0:02:25,000
 My love

27
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,841
 We're all frozen inside
