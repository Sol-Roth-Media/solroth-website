1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:05,000
 When you feel it, you just gotta goooooo

2
0:00:05,000 --> 0:00:09,000
 Always thinking though, sometimes I think I should just stay apolitical

3
0:00:09,000 --> 0:00:12,000
 Or is that really just a sign of being typical?

4
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:15,000
 My cold and clean flow, it's almost clinical

5
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:18,000
 Like execution row, time is critical

6
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:21,000
 Whack it to a winning spree

7
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:24,000
 Drive one back and roast in threes

8
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
 Backyard BBQ on your knees

9
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
 Open wide while I proselytize thee

10
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
 That means analyze your verse for free

11
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
 Breaking the fourth wall, hi it's me

12
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
 Your music's al the same, same rhyme, same lame refrain

13
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:40,000
 Never wang, just hem, just whip strained and drained

14
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:43,000
 From an amateur gone insane, no manners

15
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
 Isn't it a crime to never utilize more than 10% of the grey matter in your brain?

16
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
 Your tumor ruling, jelly brain in a fried cranium

17
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:50,000
 Starving coffin dwelling, fried green tomatoes

18
0:00:50,000 --> 0:00:53,000
 Sam, I am green, isn't I am brain?

19
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
 I think I'm experiencing an melow dramatic loss of memory

20
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
 Like voter recall

21
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
 Anyways, you should cover your assonates in it

22
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
 It's lackening, flattening, top heavy, split in sections

23
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:02,000
 No comment, back to nonsense rhymes

24
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
 It kinda makes sense at the end

25
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
 Where the vented scents are actually gathered and spent

26
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
 Sat on to you but rejected by those dejected by poetic minds

27
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:10,000
 With a sense of stench of a poor performance

28
0:01:10,000 --> 0:01:11,000
 Who realize that lines that won't even sell cents

29
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
 Don't make sense to play post-secondary school

30
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
 What?

31
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
 A slobbering bag of gruel

32
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 Is what's offered to pay the pack

33
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:20,000
 A pack of another author's back

34
0:01:20,000 --> 0:01:21,000
 Garnished with never-ending lies

35
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
 You ready here?

36
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
 I declare

37
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
 Your one-backed rose to be

38
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 Back your baby-kew on your knees

39
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 Open wide while I proselytize these

40
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
 Leveled up

41
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
 At the ending phase

42
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
 Power plays

43
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
 To raise the stakes

44
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
 1,000 heroes in a million plays

45
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:45,000
 Cause the hero's birth is the one that pays

46
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:46,000
 Leveled up

47
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
 At the ending phase

48
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
 Hero's birth is the one that pays

49
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
 Thousand heroes in a million plays

50
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
 Cause the hero's bear is the one that pays

51
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 Leveled up, the end is near

52
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
 We begin a revolution on a whim and a care

53
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 To put forth musical comprehension

54
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
 The prayer to the throne is rare as intellectual ascension

55
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
 Neither truth nor crooked dare

56
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 Could break the masses of the unwavering stare

57
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
 Unfair, can't I unravel the farthest tales of a person's worth

58
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
 Like a ship's abode sinking alone

59
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 Foretold as waves the ocean comes forth

60
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
 Calling poisonous all notions that the noise has been missed

61
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
 You miss the musty air and the quickness of steam from the sinking ocean

62
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
 You are besieged, you feel the ocean

63
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
 But the rest of this world is down to the sink

64
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
 This is a temporal message of

65
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
 Hurrying you down to the ocean

66
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
 Please don't stop staring at the air

67
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
 The ocean, the breath, the arms, don't stop it

68
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
 This is the end

69
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
 Leveled up, the end defends

70
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
 The power flames to raise the sails

71
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
 Though this ain't a passing maze

72
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
 But a wave of forked decays

73
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
 Silhouettes step down in tragic plays

74
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
 Play for play, the underdogs raise the stage

75
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
 It stays black but never fades

76
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
 We extinguish the brightest blade, darkness

77
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
 To the end of days

78
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
 Aha, slowly fade away

79
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:00,000
 What the fuck am I talking about?

80
0:03:00,000 --> 0:03:02,000
 Run, this ain't a passing maze

81
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
 But a fork stuck in different ways

82
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
 Solve it with a secret phrase

83
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:06,000
 Don't graze me, bro

84
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:07,841
 Kill not taze
