1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:10,860
 As long as we're living like we're living our last dreams

2
0:00:10,860 --> 0:00:14,060
 We don't care what anyone has got to say

3
0:00:14,060 --> 0:00:17,060
 Just love each other every day

4
0:00:17,060 --> 0:00:20,020
 Cause me and you, and you and me

5
0:00:20,020 --> 0:00:22,520
 In this fantasy

6
0:00:22,520 --> 0:00:25,600
 Cause I love you and you love me

7
0:00:25,600 --> 0:00:28,600
 And we love to say I love you

8
0:00:28,600 --> 0:00:34,200
 Even in our stupid popcorn dreams, I say I love you too

9
0:00:34,200 --> 0:00:40,000
 I love you, l-l-l-love you

10
0:00:40,000 --> 0:00:46,000
 In our little fantasy, like we're living our last dream

11
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:53,200
 Fantasy world, I can be your boy and you can be my girl

12
0:00:53,200 --> 0:00:59,000
 My lady, it's handsomely together for the world

13
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:05,000
 Handsomely, like we're living out our last dream

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:10,200
 In our fantasy world, ecstasy guaranteed

15
0:01:10,200 --> 0:01:15,000
 Like we're living our last dream, easily, we laughily

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
 Playing sauce against the world

17
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
 Like we're living our last dream

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:26,000
 Like we're living our last dream, easily, we laughily

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
 Playing sauce against the world

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:33,000
 And you know, like it's living our last dream

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
 You don't even have to say it, I can see

22
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
 But I know you like to say you love me

23
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:47,000
 I love you, even in our popcorn dreams

24
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:52,000
 I'll always say I love you too

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
 That's me and you

26
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
 I love it, I love how cheesily we can be

27
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
 And all our care is given

28
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
 Cause it's us against the world

29
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
 In our fantasy dream

30
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
 My lady, and I'm your majesty

31
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
 Or is it me, a gallant dream

32
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
 Calvary, it's at your side

33
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
 Oh, I sit here and I make believe

34
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
 That we and you have seen

35
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
 Like we're living our last dream

36
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
 Easily, we laughily

37
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
 Playing sauce against the world

38
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
 Like it's living our last dream

39
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
 Like we both took ecstasy

40
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:46,000
 It's so vivid, it's so perfect, you and me

41
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,241
 Cause it's my lady, or is it my majesty
